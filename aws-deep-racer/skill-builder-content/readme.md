# AWS DeepRacer: Driven by Reinforcement Learning

> To enroll this course, please check: https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/87/aws-deepracer-driven-by-reinforcement-learning

This course is designed to give you hands-on experience with reinforcement learning (RL) by helping you build, train and deploy models in AWS DeepRacer so you can compete in the official AWS DeepRacer League.


The course starts off by orienting you to AWS DeepRacer before diving into RL. You’ll have several opportunities to build, train, and evaluate your own RL models, and then deploy them to the physical car.


By the end of the course, you’ll have your own optimized RL model that you can enter into a virtual or physical circuit of the AWS DeepRacer League.
