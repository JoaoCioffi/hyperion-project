- [DeepHash](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/deephash.html): Hash any object based on their content.
- [Delta](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/delta.html): Store the difference of objects and apply them to other objects.
- [Extract](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/extract.html): Extract an item from a nested Python object using its path.
- [commandline](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/commandline.html): Use DeepDiff from commandline.

DeepDiff 6-3-1

This release includes many bug fixes.

- Bugfix deephash for paths by [maggelus](https://github.com/maggelus)
- Bugfix deephash compiled regex [maggelus](https://github.com/maggelus)
- Fix tests dependent on toml by [martin-kokos](https://github.com/martin-kokos)
- Bugfix for `include_paths` for nested dictionaries by [kor4ik](https://github.com/kor4ik)
- Use tomli and tomli-w for dealing with tomli files by [martin-kokos](https://github.com/martin-kokos)
- Bugfix for `datetime.date` by [Alex Sauer-Budge](https://github.com/amsb)


DeepDiff 6-3-0

- [`PrefixOrSuffixOperator`](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/custom.html#prefix-or-suffix-operator-label): This operator will skip strings that are suffix or prefix of each other.
- [`include_obj_callback`](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/ignore_types_or_values.html#include-obj-callback-label) and `include_obj_callback_strict` are added by [HÃ¥vard Thom](https://github.com/havardthom).
- Fixed a corner case where numpy's `np.float32` nans are not ignored when using `ignore_nan_equality` by [Noam Gottlieb](https://github.com/noamgot)
- `orjson` becomes optional again.
- Fix for `ignore_type_in_groups` with numeric values so it does not report number changes when the number types are different.

`pip install "deepdiff[optimize]"`

Install optional packages:
- [yaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
- [tomli](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/) (python 3.10 and older) and [tomli-w](https://pypi.org/project/tomli-w/) for writing
- [clevercsv](https://pypi.org/project/clevercsv/) for more rubust CSV parsing
- [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) for speed and memory optimized parsing
- [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/)

# Survey

:mega: **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/E6qXexcgjoKnSzjB8)** so that we can learn how & why you use DeepDiff, and what improvements we should make. Thank you! :dancers:


# Contribute

1. Please make your PR against the dev branch
2. Please make sure that your PR has tests. Since DeepDiff is used in many sensitive data driven projects, we strive to maintain around 100% test coverage on the code.

Please run `pytest --cov=deepdiff --runslow` to see the coverage report. Note that the `--runslow` flag will run some slow tests too. In most cases you only want to run the fast tests which so you wont add the `--runslow` flag.

Or to see a more user friendly version, please run: `pytest --cov=deepdiff --cov-report term-missing --runslow`.

Thank you!
